Description: This simple R package can be used to calculate a useful QC metric 
    for single cell RNA-seq datasets generated with the 10x Genomics Chromium
    Single Cell Gene Expression platform: the nuclear fraction score. This score
    captures, for each input cell barcode, the fraction of RNA that likely 
    originated from unspliced (nuclear) pre-mRNA. Sheared cell membranes from 
    damaged cells in the input cell suspension primarily release cytoplasmic RNA
    into solution, while the nuclear envelope remains intact. As a result, RNA
    released from stressed or damaged cells consists mostly of mature 
    cytoplasmic mRNA and is relatively depleted of unspliced nuclear precursor 
    mRNA. This fact can be useful in identifying both; droplets containing only 
    ambient RNA, characterised by a low nuclear fraction score, and damaged 
    cells, which can be identified by a high score. The QC metric is calculated 
    by parsing the input barcoded BAM file for CB and RE flags added by 10x 
    Genomics' Cell Ranger software.
